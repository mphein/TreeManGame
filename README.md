Tree Man Game

Worked with a team to complete a 5 week project in Phaser3. We created a game which resulted from numerous prototypes, brainstorms, and playtests. This game features a controllable tree man who must collect raindrops to restore vitality to nature across the world. The tree man faces challenges along the way, but can use his rain to upgrade his powers and progress to further levels.

I implemented most of the classes, physics, and player input. I also set up general scene structure and contributed to brainstorms and the game's design. It was a very good learning experience in terms of communication, collaboration, and meeting deadlines as a team. 

Challenges: Meeting deadlines and keeping each other motivated throughout the project. Scoping the game down into a 5 week project after prototyping and brainstorming the first few weeks.
Learned: Collaboration and communicational skills. Designing and implementing a game in Phaser3.
